    "This project will aim to consider potential areas for a family to move to in the city of Edinburgh in Scotland. This will be based on similarity to the area they currently live, based on the k-Means clustering method using the relative presence of different types of venues returned by the Foursquare app. The audience will be real estate agents in Edinburgh, as they may use the resulting clusters to recommend particular areas to move to."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "### Data collection and cleaning\n",
    "I used the Beautiful Soup package to scrape the Edinburgh 'outcodes' from the Wikipedia page. I then used the Postcodes.io outcodes API to get the latitude and longitude of those outcodes. I saw that there were some special postcodes e.g. that for the Scottish Parliament. These were not areas that someone could live in, so I removed them by filtering on the phrase \"Special postcode\" appearing in the 'coverage' column. I then used the Foursquare API with the explore parameter and the different latitudes and longitudes to get the venues around each postcode. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "I counted the number of venue results by area giving the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Outcode|Number of results|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "|EH1|100|\n",
    "|EH2|100|\n",
    "|EH3|100|\n",

    "|EH15|26|\n",
    "|EH16|20|\n",
    "|EH17|14|\n",
    "|EH28|4|\n",
    "|EH29|5|\n",
    "|EH30|31|\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the densely populated city-centre postcodes (EH1, EH2 & EH3) had the maximum number of returned venues (100) and I was concerned that there could be duplicate venues as searches were allocated just based on the radius around that search.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also counted the unique venue categories per outcode:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Outcode|Unique venue categories|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "|EH1|53|\n",

    "|EH29|5|\n",
    "|EH30|19|\n",
    "\n",
    "I noted the high number of unique categories as a proporition of the total venues in each area. By looking at the data I could see there were a lot of subsets of restaurants (e.g. American Restaurant, Argentinian restaurant, etc) as well as a lot of different ways to describe cafes. I was concerned this could impact the clustering, by suggesting greater differences between areas than is useful for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to proceed with clustering using the k-Means algorithm, part of the Scikit Learn Package - with 5 clusters. and then consider the above concerns in light of the result. I examined the cluster sizes and got the following numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Cluster|Number of areas|\n",
    "|:---|:---|\n",
    "|1|3|\n",
    "|2|11|\n",
    "|3|3|\n",
    "|4|1|\n",
    "|5|2|\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that there was one big cluster did reinforce the above concerns. In addition, the resulting map showed that most of the city was in cluster 2 and it was only areas on the periphery of the city that were clustered differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"model4a.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "That suggested this model may not provide insights of interest to real estate agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revised model\n",
    "I made two revisions to the model. To resolve my concerns about the number of unique categories I recoded the venue categories to phrase them more generally. This was done by exporting the list of unique categories and then manually giving more general category names. This was then merged with the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to resolve my concern about venues appearing in multiple areas (and that venues were included in postcodes in which they weren't present) I decided to set the postcode based on the venue location rather than the search location. I again did this with the Postcodes.io outcodes API. I then dropped duplicate locations. I then reran the clustering algorithm.\n",

    "Uses of this clustering could include providing inspiration. So if someone is interested in moving to Marchmont (EH9) on the Southside of Edinburgh you may suggest the EH6 postcode in the North of Edinburgh because they are both in cluster 4. Greater potential could be achieved by using the Zoopla API to find average house prices in these areas - allowing you to narrow down areas both by similarity and by price."
